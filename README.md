**Welcome to the World of Python!**

Python is a fun language to learn, and really easy to pick up even if you are new to programming. In fact, quite often, Python is easier to pick up if you do not have any programming experience whatsoever. Python is high level programming language, targeted at students and professionals from diverse backgrounds.

Python has two flavors -- Python 2 and Python 3. This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. Note that Jupyter sets up a `localhost:8888` server to render the notebook in your computer's browser. It can render anything thereafter -- should be fun! Once you are familiar with the Jupyter Notebook environment, and the basic Python syntax in [Module 0](Module0_TheNotebook.ipynb), feel free to explore the rest of the Python Modules.

> [Module 1](Module1_DataTypes.ipynb) : Data Types in Python  
> [Module 2](Module2_DataStructures.ipynb) : Data Structures in Python   
> [Module 3](Module3_ConditionLoop.ipynb) : Conditions and Loops in Python   
> [Module 4](Module4_Functions.ipynb) : Functions and Modules in Python   
> [Module 5](Module5_PythonComputing.ipynb) : Computing with Python

This set of introductory material for Python is heavilly inspired from two wonderful lecture series in Python, as follows.

- Python4Maths by Andreas Ernst : https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths
- Python Lectures by Rajath Kumar : https://github.com/rajathkmp/Python-Lectures

Highly recommended : [Python 3 Cheat Sheet](pythonCheatSheet.pdf) by [Laurent Pointal](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/python:memento)
