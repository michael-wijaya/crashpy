# CrashPy

**Welcome to the World of Python!**

This is a crash course in Python, with Jupyter Notebook as the User Interface (IDE). I hope you'll like the experience.

Python is a fun language to learn, and really easy to pick up even if you are new to programming. In fact, quite often, Python is easier to pick up if you do not have any programming experience whatsoever. Python is a high level programming language, targeted at students and professionals from diverse backgrounds.

Python has two flavors -- Python 2 and Python 3. This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. Note that Jupyter sets up a `localhost:8888` server to render the notebook in your computer's browser. It can render anything thereafter -- should be fun! Once you are familiar with the Jupyter Notebook environment, and the basic Python syntax in [Module 0](Module0_TheNotebook.ipynb), feel free to explore the rest of the Python Modules.

> [Module 0](Module0_TheNotebook.ipynb) : Python in Jupyter   
> [Module 1](Module1_DataTypes.ipynb) : Data Types in Python  
> [Module 2](Module2_DataStructures.ipynb) : Data Structures in Python   
> [Module 3](Module3_ConditionLoop.ipynb) : Conditions and Loops in Python   
> [Module 4](Module4_Functions.ipynb) : Functions and Modules in Python   
> [Module 5](Module5_PythonComputing.ipynb) : Computing with Python

To get the most out of this crash course, you'll need to download and use the Jupyter Notebooks for individual Modules, posted in this repository. Before you do that, prepare your computer by installing the following.

> Core Engine : Python 3.7 (https://www.python.org/)    
> Package Manager : MiniConda (https://conda.io/miniconda.html)  
> User Interface (IDE) : Jupyter Notebook (install using Conda)

In case installing the above three is too difficult or confusing for you, you may also download and install the full Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) package for Python 3.7.

This set of introductory material for Python is heavily inspired from two wonderful lecture series in Python, as follows.

- Python4Maths by Andreas Ernst : https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths
- Python Lectures by Rajath Kumar : https://github.com/rajathkmp/Python-Lectures

**Highly recommended** : [Python 3 Cheat Sheet](pythonCheatSheet.pdf) by [Laurent Pointal](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/python:memento). This 2-pager is a life-saver -- print and frame it!
